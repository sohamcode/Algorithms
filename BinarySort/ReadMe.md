I am a big fan of Binary Tree and recursion.  When applied correctly, it can create wonders.

While learning searching and sorthing algorithms in Programming-101, I didn't find a sorting
algorithms employing the benefits of binary tree. So I quickly researched a bit and found some 
algorithms in bits and pieces. I did find it some advance textbooks but it was explained in a complicated way.

So this is my attempt to implement binary tree for orting :)

List of files and brief explanation:
1. BinarySort.ppt: A powerpoint presentation explaining the idea with an example
2. BinarySort_v1.py: First attempt to implement binary sort.

Feel free to message me if you need any help in understanding or find any mistakes. :)
